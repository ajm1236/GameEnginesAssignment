# Description of the Project  
Inspired by the intro to the classic British sci-fi show 'Doctor Who' [![Doctor Who Intro ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1fnzcAFy8d8&ab_channel=DoctorWho/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fnzcAFy8d8&ab_channel=DoctorWho)
this project loosely recreates the time vortex in which The Doctor and his time travelling spaceship, the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimensions in Space) fly through the
time vortex and their way to their next adventure.
# Instructions For Use
The up and down arrow keys control the distance in which the TARDIS is from the Main Camera.  
The left and right arrow keys control the speed of rotation of the TARDIS (can rotate either way).  
'w' & 's' control the speed of the Time Vortex.
Pressing the 'r' key will reset the speeds, the distance, and the rotation.  
# How It Works
We follow the TARDIS along while it is flying through the Time Vortex with the famous long lasting theme tune playing in the background.
