# Description of the Project  
Inspired by the intro to the classic British sci-fi show 'Doctor Who' [![Doctor Who Intro ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1fnzcAFy8d8&ab_channel=DoctorWho/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fnzcAFy8d8&ab_channel=DoctorWho)
this project loosely recreates the time vortex in which The Doctor, their comapanion(s) and their time travelling spaceship, the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimensions in Space) fly through the
time vortex and their way to their next adventure.  
  
Users will be able to see the TARDIS fly through a multicoloured Time Vortex, and take control of the TARDIS which is outlined below.  
# Instructions For Use
The up and down arrow keys control the distance in which the TARDIS is from the Main Camera.  
The left and right arrow keys control the speed of rotation of the TARDIS (can rotate either way).  
'w' & 's' control the speed of the Time Vortex.
Pressing the 'r' key will reset the speeds, the distance, and the rotation.  
# How It Works
We follow the TARDIS along while it is flying through the Time Vortex with the famous long lasting theme tune playing in the background.  
The TARDIS and Time Vortex can be moved with the controls above.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment  
I am most proud of the Time Vortex that I created. Getting all the trails to compliment one another, very difficult to get the art direction correct so that each trail goes with the other in order to create the Time Vortex look that I was going for. Figuring out the different widths and colour gradients really added up to a Time Vortex I am very proud of. Also figuring out the different angles for each trail and which direction it should go in.  
  
Creating the TARIDS would be the next thing, I spent hours in ProBuilder trying to figure out the best way to create the TARDIS and I think it cam out very well.
# What I learned  
I learned about the different tools of ProBuilder and creating my own models/assets in more detail.  
I learned how to implement Trail Renderers in order to create the Time Vortex.  
Implemented phyllotaxis to recreate my favourite TV shows intro.  
How to add lights to a Unity Project and how to alter its rotation, intensity and make it flash.  
Adding music to a project.
